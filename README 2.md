# Flask-Bootstrap

Welcome to my opinionated, lightweight Flask project template.

## Quick start

1. After installing [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/), create and boot the VM inside this directory:

        vagrant up

2. SSH to the VM:

        vagrant ssh

3. Run your app:

        fab run

You will have a running app listening on http://localhost:5000/ at this point.

## Notes

After initial boot, you should:

* Freeze the newly-installed pip packages at their versions:

        pip freeze > requirements.txt

* Set the `SECRET_KEY` for each environment in `app/config/`.

## Requirements

*nix-flavoured OS.
